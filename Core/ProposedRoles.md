# Proposed Future Roles

This document contains conceptual designs for new roles following the strict game design principles of the advanced autonomous Game-Design AI.

Role Name: The Parity-Link
Team: Crewmate
Core Concept:

Information is not absolute; it is a relationship. The Parity-Link senses "imbalance" and must synchronize states to reveal truth.

Primary Novel Mechanic:

State-Entanglement: Instead of checking a player's role, the Parity-Link links two players. They receive a "Dissonance" signal if the two players have different alignment (one Impostor, one Crewmate). If both are Crewmates or both are Impostors, they receive a "Harmony" signal.

Active Abilities:

Entangle: Select two players. After 5 seconds, receive a "Dissonance" or "Harmony" flash. The linked players are notified that they are "Entangled" and can see each other's outline in white for 10 seconds.

Passive Effects:

Decoherence: If either entangled player dies during the link, the Parity-Link is "Dazed" (slowed) for the next round.

Constraints & Failure States:

Knowing that "Red and Blue are the same" doesn't tell you what they are. If you link an Impostor with another Impostor, you get "Harmony," which might make you think they are both Crewmates. It requires comparing multiple pairs.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:

Impostors can exploit "Harmony" by sticking together or by killing one of a "Dissonant" pair to frame the other.

Uniqueness Proof:

It's not a Sheriff (who kills) or an Investigator (who sees footprints). It's a "Binary Comparative" role. It creates a logic puzzle that requires at least 3 people to solve definitively.

Role Name: The Sunk-Cost
Team: Impostor
Core Concept:

Parasitic trust. The more a Crewmate "invests" in the Sunk-Cost, the more powerful the Sunk-Cost becomes, but the more the Crewmate is rewarded for the Sunk-Cost's survival.

Primary Novel Mechanic:

Cognitive Debt: When a Crewmate spends time near the Sunk-Cost, they accumulate "Investment." High investment grants the Sunk-Cost abilities, but it also gives the Crewmate a "Dividend" (e.g., faster task completion).

Active Abilities:

Leverage Kill: Kill a player. The cooldown is reduced significantly based on the total Investment in the Sunk-Cost by all living Crewmates.
Forgive Debt: Instantly complete a task for a nearby Crewmate, gaining a massive boost in their "Investment" in you.

Passive Effects:

Loss Aversion: If the Sunk-Cost is voted out, any Crewmate with high "Investment" also suffers a penalty (e.g., they lose the ability to use Admin/Cams/Vitals for the rest of the game).

Constraints & Failure States:

If the Sunk-Cost kills a high-investment player, they lose all the cooldown bonuses provided by that player. They want to keep their "investors" alive as long as possible.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:

Crewmates must weigh the personal benefit of the "Dividend" against the risk of powering up the Impostor. "Why is my task bar moving so fast when I'm with Green? Oh no, I'm investing in the Impostor!"

Uniqueness Proof:

It turns "grouping with a safe person" into a mechanical risk. It's the first role that gives positive buffs to its enemies to gain an advantage.
