# Proposed Roles

This document contains conceptual designs for novel Among Us roles generated by the Game-Design AI.

Role Name: The Scrutineer
Team: Crewmate
Core Concept:
The act of witnessing is a physical force; the Scrutineer weaponizes the collective attention of the crew to create zones of absolute truth and accountability.

Primary Novel Mechanic:
Gaze Pressure: The Scrutineer can see a faint "visual cone" for every player on their screen (representing where their camera is centered). When multiple cones overlap on a single player or object, that entity becomes "Under Scrutiny." An Impostor "Under Scrutiny" cannot kill or vent, and their movement speed is slightly reduced.

Active Abilities:
- Focus Beam: For 10 seconds, the Scrutineer's own gaze cone becomes 3x wider and "pins" anyone it touches, making them "Under Scrutiny" even if no one else is looking.
- Audit Trace: Target a room. The Scrutineer sees a "Heatmap" of where players were looking in that room for the last 15 seconds.

Passive Effects:
- Collective Awareness: If the Scrutineer is "Under Scrutiny" by at least two other players, they can see the names of everyone currently looking at the Admin map or Vitals.

Constraints & Failure States:
If the Scrutineer "pins" an innocent player who is trying to run to a meeting or fix a sabotage, they might slow them down enough to let an Impostor escape. The Scrutineer is also a prime target because they can "stun" Impostors just by looking at them.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:
Impostors must learn to "look away" from their victims or wait for moments when the Scrutineer is distracted. They can also use "decoys" (two people standing together) to dilute the gaze pressure.

Uniqueness Proof:
Unlike "Security" roles that use fixed cameras or "Watchers" that see through walls, the Scrutineer's effectiveness is dynamic and tied to the real-time behavioral psychology of the players' viewpoints. It turns "looking" into an active game mechanic.

Role Name: The Entangler
Team: Impostor
Core Concept:
Breaking the fundamental link between cause and effect; the Entangler makes one person's actions the physical responsibility of another.

Primary Novel Mechanic:
Kinetic Entanglement: The Entangler can "link" two players. For the next 20 seconds, the "physical consequences" of one player are transferred to the other. If Player A (Entangled) walks over a vent, Player B (Entangled) is the one who appears to "vent." If Player A kills, the body appears at Player B's location, and Player B's hands are "bloody" (visible to roles like the Scrutineer).

Active Abilities:
- Quantum Link: Select two players to entangle. They are unaware of the link until an action occurs.
- Collapse State: Instantly end the entanglement, causing both players to swap positions.

Passive Effects:
- Indeterminacy: The Entangler does not appear on Vitals or Admin map as a single icon; they appear as two flickering icons in different rooms, making their true location uncertain.

Constraints & Failure States:
If the Entangler entangles two people who are standing next to each other, the effect is obvious and useless. If they collapse the state at the wrong time, they might accidentally save a Crewmate from a kill.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:
Crewmates must verify "double locations." If someone is seen in two places at once (due to Indeterminacy), the crew knows an Entangler is active. Entangled players must communicate to realize their actions are being mirrored or transferred.

Uniqueness Proof:
It is not "Shapeshifting" (changing your own look) or "Puppeteering" (forcing words). It is "Action Transfer." It forces the crew to doubt the fundamental law of "whoever is at the body is the killer."
