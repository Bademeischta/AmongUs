# Proposed Custom Roles

This document outlines the conceptual designs for new Among Us roles, generated by the Game-Design AI.

## MANDATORY THINKING PHASE: Session 1

### 1. Abstracting Known Mechanics
- **Identity Verification:** (Sheriff, Seer) -> Binary state check.
- **Spatial Tracking:** (Tracker, Watcher) -> Coordinate correlation.
- **Action Attribution:** (Kill-variant, Venting) -> Action-ID mapping.

### 2. Reduction to Fundamental Patterns
- **Pattern A:** Truth = State (Good/Evil).
- **Pattern B:** Truth = Location (Where were you?).
- **Pattern C:** Truth = Interaction (What did you do?).

### 3. Exclusions
- No binary state checks (Sheriff).
- No coordinate mapping (Tracker).
- No simple action-ID mapping (Kill-variant).

### 4. Unexplored Design Space
- **Linguistics:** The impact of chat content on game reality.
- **Epistemology:** Verifying claims against abstract event sequences rather than player IDs.
- **Information Theory:** Conditional invisibility based on shared knowledge.

Role Name: The Mnemonist
Team: Crewmate
Core Concept:
The Mnemonist treats the game world as a sequence of abstract interactions, allowing them to verify if a player's story matches the "rhythm" of a specific room's history.

Primary Novel Mechanic:
Sequential Event Validation: The Mnemonist records room events as a list of abstract types (e.g., [Task Start], [Vent Entry], [Task Stop]). During meetings, they compare a player's actual action history against this sequence to identify "Logical Dissonance."

Active Abilities:
- **Epistemic Anchor:** Target a room to record every abstract "Game Event" (but not actor identity) for 60 seconds.
- **Query Dissonance:** During a meeting, select a player and a room. The system checks if that player's history could have logically produced the recorded sequence. A "Dissonance Flash" occurs if a discrepancy is found.

Passive Effects:
- **Lingering Echo:** When entering a room where an Anchor was active, the Mnemonist sees the total event count as a static number.

Constraints & Failure States:
- High noise in crowded rooms makes attribution difficult.
- Impostors can "pollute" the record by spamming actions to create a complex, confusing sequence.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:
- Impostors can stay still in Anchored rooms to create a "Blank Sequence" and then claim they were active, triggering a mismatch.
- Crewmates must be precise with their movement descriptions to avoid triggering false dissonance.

Uniqueness Proof:
Unlike a Tracker, it focuses on the **logical consistency of action types** rather than spatial coordinates or identity.

Role Name: The Sophist
Team: Impostor
Core Concept:
The Sophist weaponizes the act of communication, turning the Crew's discussion into a minefield where specific words grant the Impostor supernatural advantages.

Primary Novel Mechanic:
Meta-Linguistic Conditional Invisibility: Tying invisibility and perception states to the specific linguistic choices made by players in the chat interface.

Active Abilities:
- **Define Taboo:** During a meeting, select one word from a rotating list of essential game terms (e.g., "Medbay", "Red", "Vent").
- **Semantic Phasing:** In the following round, any player who typed the Taboo word in the previous meeting becomes "Infected." The Sophist is invisible to Infected players.
- **The False Premise:** Once per game, the Sophist can invert the effect, becoming invisible to everyone who *didn't* say the word.

Passive Effects:
- **Linguistic Silence:** If a player uses the Taboo word too frequently, they are muted for the final seconds of the meeting.

Constraints & Failure States:
- Picking an unused word results in no advantage.
- The Sophist remains physically tangible and can be discovered by "bumping" into players.

Counterplay & Meta Interaction:
- The Crew must develop a "Code Language" or synonyms (e.g., "The infirmary" for "Medbay") to bypass the Taboo.
- Creates social suspicion around players who suddenly change their speaking patterns.

Uniqueness Proof:
The first role to directly link the **social layer (chat)** to the **mechanical layer (visibility)** in a non-automated way.
