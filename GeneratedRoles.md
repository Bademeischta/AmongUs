**Role Name:** The Chronicler
**Team:** Crewmate
**Core Concept:** This role explores the fallibility of memory and the power of objective truth in a game of subjective accusations. It introduces a mechanic where a single, perfect piece of evidence can be presented, but its value is entirely dependent on social consensus.

**Primary Novel Mechanic:** *Verifiable History*. The Chronicler can "record" a player, creating a perfect, undeniable snapshot of their state (location, appearance, living/dead status) at that exact moment. This recording can only be revealed during a meeting, forcing a public reckoning with a piece of irrefutable, but context-free, data.

**Active Abilities:**
- *Chronicle:* Target a player to create a single "Memory Echo." This action has a long cooldown and can only be used a limited number of times per game. The Echo is stored secretly.
- *Recount:* During a meeting, reveal one stored Memory Echo to all players. The Echo displays the player's name, their exact location on the map, and their status (alive/dead/color) from the moment of recording. This action can only be done once per game.

**Passive Effects:**
- None. The Chronicler's power is entirely in the active application of information.

**Constraints & Failure States:**
- The Memory Echo has no context. It doesn't show who else was there or what happened a second before or after. Revealing an Echo of a Crewmate in a compromising location can easily backfire, leading to a misinterpretation and a wrongful ejection.
- If the Chronicler is killed before they can Recount, their stored Echoes are lost forever.
- Using Recount too early might waste the game's single most powerful piece of evidence. Using it too late might be useless. The timing and target selection are critical social gambles.

**Counterplay & Meta Interaction:**
- Impostors can exploit the lack of context. If an Impostor knows they were Chronicled, they can create a false narrative around the inevitable Echo. ("Yes, you saw me near the body, I was chasing the real killer!")
- Crewmates must learn to be skeptical of even perfect evidence. A Chronicler's Echo is a fact, but the interpretation of that fact becomes the new focus of debate.
- The existence of a Chronicler forces all players to be more mindful of their positioning and alibis at all times, as any moment could be recorded.

**Uniqueness Proof:** This role is not an "investigator" or "seer." It doesn't receive secret information or see "auras." The information it gathers is objective but its *meaning* is purely social. Unlike roles that grant vision or knowledge, the Chronicler's power is in forcing the group to confront a single, decontextualized truth and debate its significance, shifting the game from "what happened?" to "what does this fact *mean*?".

**Role Name:** The Parasite
**Team:** Impostor
**Core Concept:** This role explores indirect influence and cascading consequences. It's an Impostor who wins not by direct violence, but by turning the Crewmates' own actions against them, transforming the ship's systems into vectors for a slow, creeping infection.

**Primary Novel Mechanic:** *Systemic Infection*. The Parasite cannot kill. Instead, it "infects" sabotage panels. When a Crewmate fixes an infected sabotage, they become a "Host." The Parasite's goal is to make every living Crewmate a Host, at which point they can trigger a final, game-winning ability.

**Active Abilities:**
- *Infect:* Target a sabotage panel (e.g., Lights, Comms, O2, Reactor). This panel is now visually indistinguishable but flagged as "infected." This has a moderate cooldown.
- *Propagate:* This ability is only available when all living Crewmates are Hosts. Activating it instantly wins the game for the Impostors. It has no channel time and can be used from anywhere.

**Passive Effects:**
- The Parasite is a normal Impostor in all other ways (can vent, appears as Impostor to teammates) but their "Kill" button is replaced with "Infect."
- Crewmates who become Hosts are unaware of their status. There is no visual or audio cue for the Host. The only way to know is to remember who fixed which sabotage.

**Constraints & Failure States:**
- The Parasite has no direct way to eliminate threats. A Crewmate who figures out the Parasite's identity can call a meeting and expose them with little personal risk.
- If the other Impostor is voted out, the Parasite is left with no way to kill, making it a race against time to infect everyone before the Crewmates complete tasks.
- If Crewmates become suspicious, they can intentionally leave infected sabotages unfixed, forcing the Parasite to change tactics or risk being discovered.

**Counterplay & Meta Interaction:**
- The core counterplay is information-driven. Crewmates must start tracking *who* fixes sabotages. A player who frequently rushes to fix things might be a diligent Crewmate or an unwitting pawn.
- This creates a new social dynamic where fixing a sabotage is no longer a purely heroic act. It could be a risk. "Don't fix lights yet, let's see who's pushing for it."
- The Parasite's existence encourages Impostor teammates to play differently. They might call "decoy" sabotages to lure Crewmates into infected panels, or protect the Parasite more aggressively since they lack direct killing power.

**Uniqueness Proof:** The Parasite is not a "saboteur" or a "converter." It doesn't create new Impostors. The "Host" status is a hidden state, not a team change. It wins by manipulating the game's core objectives, turning helpful actions (fixing sabotages) into a vector for its own victory condition. Its win is achieved not through attrition (killing), but through total, indirect control over the crew's unwitting actions.
